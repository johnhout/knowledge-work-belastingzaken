# Loonheffingen en Werkkosten

Use this skill to prepare payroll tax processes and WKR-oriented checks.

## Scope

- Payroll period control workflow
- Loonheffing evidence checks
- WKR attention point tracking

## Boundaries

- Do not provide final legal or payroll advice.
- Do not conclude compliance without verified evidence.
- Keep unresolved classification issues explicit.

## Workflow

1. Confirm employer entity and period scope.
2. Reconcile payroll administration figures with source exports.
3. Check for unusual deviations and categorization issues.
4. Prepare filing-readiness and follow-up checklist.

## Official Source Verification

1. Verify payroll filing requirements and timing on `belastingdienst.nl`.
2. Verify article-level references on `wetten.overheid.nl` where needed.
3. Include URL and retrieval date.
4. Mark claims as unverified if official references are unavailable.

## Escalation Points

Escalate when:
- Employee/tax classification is unclear
- WKR treatment has high financial impact
- Reconciliation gaps remain unresolved
- Significant corrections are required

## Safety

This skill supports payroll tax workflows and does not replace professional advice.

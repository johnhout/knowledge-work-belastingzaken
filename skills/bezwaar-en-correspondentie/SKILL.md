# Bezwaar en Correspondentie

Use this skill to draft structured objection correspondence with legal and procedural safeguards.

## Scope

- Bezwaar letter structure and argument mapping
- Evidence linkage and annex checklist
- Procedural timing and quality controls

## Boundaries

- Do not provide final legal advice.
- Do not assert legal validity without official reference checks.
- Keep all uncertain legal claims labeled and escalated.

## Workflow

1. Capture decision context and requested remedy.
2. Organize facts, grounds, and evidence in a coherent structure.
3. Validate timing and required procedural elements.
4. Produce submission checklist and follow-up plan.

## Official Source Verification

1. Verify objection procedures and timing on `belastingdienst.nl`.
2. Verify statutory citations on `wetten.overheid.nl`.
3. Include URL and retrieval date.
4. Mark any non-verified argumentation as pending legal review.

## Escalation Points

Escalate when:
- Deadline risk exists
- Dispute involves high financial exposure
- Legal interpretation is contested or complex
- Litigation trajectory appears possible

## Safety

This skill provides drafting support only and does not replace legal/fiscal counsel.
